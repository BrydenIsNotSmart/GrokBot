# Terms of Service

Last updated: January 21, 2026

## Acceptance of Terms

By inviting, using, or interacting with the Discord bot **Gork** (the “Bot”), you agree to these Terms of Service.

If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Bot.

---

## Description of Service

Gork is a Discord bot that allows users to interact with xAI’s Grok model within Discord.

Users provide prompts by mentioning or replying to the Bot. The Bot forwards the prompt to a third-party API and returns the generated response in the same channel.

The Bot is provided on an **“as-is”** and **“as-available”** basis.

---

## User Responsibilities

By using the Bot, you agree:
- To comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines
- Not to use the Bot for illegal, abusive, or malicious purposes
- Not to attempt to exploit, overload, or reverse-engineer the Bot or its services

You are responsible for any content you submit to the Bot.

---

## Data Usage

The Bot processes message content only when explicitly invoked by a user.

- Message content is not stored
- Minimal operational data (such as user IDs and cooldown timestamps) may be stored
- Message content may be sent to third-party services (xAI) for response generation

For more information, please review the Bot’s Privacy Policy.

---

## Third-Party Services

The Bot relies on third-party services, including the xAI (Grok) API.

The Bot developer is not responsible for:
- The availability or reliability of third-party services
- The content or accuracy of responses generated by third-party AI models
- Any changes made by third-party providers

---

## Limitations of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- The Bot developer shall not be liable for any damages or losses resulting from the use or inability to use the Bot
- AI-generated responses may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate and should not be relied upon as professional advice

---

## Termination

Access to the Bot may be suspended or terminated at any time, with or without notice, for any reason, including misuse or abuse.

---

## Changes to These Terms

These Terms of Service may be updated at any time. Continued use of the Bot after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
